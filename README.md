# Speckle Imaging Database

The NASA Ames Research Center Speckle Imaging Group produces the highest resolution imaging possible from a single telescope and currently operates instruments at the WIYN, Gemini-North, and Gemini-South telescopes. These instruments produce a significant volume of data.

This project is an open source, searchable database that holds terabytes of this data.
